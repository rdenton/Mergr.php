Mergr - Merge all CSS and JS files into one
===========================================

Mergr is a small program used to merge all of your stylesheets and javascript files into one global file.
It supports basic plugins and ships with shrinky by default to minify your css files.

How to use
----------

Git clone to a directory of your choice.
You may either run Mergr from the /src folder via php, or use the "built" version for a more native program approach.

To use the built version, run install.sh as root. (sudo bash install.sh)
